### For Developers

The refresh functionality is automatically available throughout the app via the `useAppRefresh` hook:

```typescript
import { useAppRefresh } from '@/hooks/useAppRefresh';

function MyComponent() {
  const { refreshApp, isRefreshing } = useAppRefresh({
    onRefresh: () => {
      // Custom refresh logic before page reload
      console.log('Custom refresh handler');
    }
  });

  return (
    <button onClick={refreshApp} disabled={isRefreshing}>
      {isRefreshing ? 'Refreshing...' : 'Refresh'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## ⚙️ Configuration
